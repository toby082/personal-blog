[Shortest path](/shortest-path.png)

Shorttest path problem is asked quite often in interviews

#### DFS or BFS?

When should I use DFS?

- When the question is asked to find the longest path between two nodes in a graph
- When the tree structure is really wide with quite a number of branches
- When it requires to check child nodes before checking sibling nodes
- When dealing with a maze or puzzle challenge

When should I use BFS?

- When you are asked to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph
- When you need to prioritizse searching leaves that are closer to the starting node

#### The code

```js
class Solution {
  shortestPath(grid, source, destination) {
    let rows = grid.length;
    let cols = grid[0].length;
    let visited = new Set();
    let [dx, dy] = destination;

    const directions = [
      [-1, 0],
      [1, 0],
      [0, 1],
      [0, -1],
    ];

    let queue = [[source[0], source[1], 0]]; // [sx, sy, dist]
    visited.add(source.join(","));

    while (queue.length > 0) {
      let [sx, sy, dist] = queue.shift();

      // if it reaches dest, return the current distance
      if (sx === dx && sy === dy) return dist;

      // bfs
      for (let direct of directions) {
        let nx = sx + direct[0];
        let ny = sy + direct[1];
        let key = nx + "," + ny;

        if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] === 1 && !visited.has(key)) {
          if (nx === dx && ny === dy) return dist + 1;
          else {
            queue.push([nx, ny, dist + 1]);
            visited.add(key);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    return -1;
  }
}
```
