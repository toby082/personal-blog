Playing with Angular Google Maps (AGM)

Create an Angular CLI project
We start by creating a project with Angular CLI. Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works and allows you to follow the best practices. I you havenâ€™t installed Angular CLI yet, please run the following command first:

npm install -g @angular/cli
Run the following commands to create a new Angular project with Angular CLI:

ng new my-maps-project
cd my-maps-project

## Steps

### Setting up Angular Google Maps

#### Install Angular Google Maps

=======

Angular Google Maps (short name: AGM) gets shipped via the Node Package Manager (NPM). Run the following command to add it to your new project:

```js
npm install @agm/core
```

#### Setup @NgModule

Open src/app/app.module.ts and import the AgmCoreModule. You neeed to provide a Google Maps API key to be able to see a Map. Get an API key here.

````js
import { AgmCoreModule } from "@agm/core";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
```

import { AgmCoreModule } from '@agm/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AgmCoreModule.forRoot({
      apiKey: "",
    }),
  ],
  providers: [],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
      apiKey: ''
    })
  ],
  providers: [],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}
````

#### Extending the app component

Angular CLI already created an app component the weâ€™ll now use to create our first google map. Open the file src/app/app.component.ts and modify it like below:

````js
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = "My first AGM project";

  title = 'My first AGM project';
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
  lat = 51.678418;
  lng = 7.809007;
}
````

#### Setup the template

Open the file src/app/app.component.html and paste the following content:

#### Setup the template

Open the file src/app/app.component.html and paste the following content:

```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<!-- this creates a google map on the page with the given lat/lng from -->
<!-- the component as the initial center of the map: -->
<agm-map [latitude]="lat" [longitude]="lng">
  <agm-marker [latitude]="lat" [longitude]="lng"></agm-marker>
</agm-map>
```

#### Setup the CSS file

Open the file src/app/app.component.css and paste the following content:

```css
agm-map {
  height: 300px;
}
```

### Build and run your application

Great! So we have created all the needed source files, so everything should be ready to build an run the application.

Run the following command in the project root folder:

Great! So we have created all the needed source files, so everything should be ready to build an run the application.

Run the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then, open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:4200/

The command starts the following things: _ Starts the TypeScript compiler and compiles all sources files (watches also for file changes in the source files and recompiles all files if something has changed) _ Starts a local web server to serve the Angular application. It refreshes the page when served files change.

## When everything works as expected, you should see your first Google Map created with AGM ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!
